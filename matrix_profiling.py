Lecture notes:
    low value in matrix profile -> there was somewhere else in the time sereis very similar to the current subsequence
    matrix profile indexs often recpricate to each other but not all the time

    motifs are low values becausse that means another sequence is similar to it, anomalys are high values because
    that means it is very far away from its closest time sequence
